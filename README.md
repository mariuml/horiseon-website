## Description

This project invovled refactoring code for a fictitious marketing team, optimising the landing page of a website for the company 'Horiseon', specialising
in search engine optimisation. 

I learnt how to refactor code to follow best practices for HTML and CSS, optimising the codebase for search engine optimisation and to meet accessibility 
standards. This took my understanding of writing semantic HTML and clean CSS to the next level through applying this knowledge to a practical real-world context. 

I learnt more about using git and git hub, including the importance of writing meaningful 'git commit' messages to recover previous codebases and work effectively with teams on coding projects in the future. 

## Usage

The landing page has been deployed at: (https://mariuml.github.io/horiseon-website/)
